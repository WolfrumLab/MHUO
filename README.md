## Abstract
Despite a large heterogeneity in the metabolic phenotype of individuals with obesity, precision medicine is still not considered as a standard of care in obesity treatment. One of the strongest factors influencing the variability in metabolic disease risk is adipose tissue (AT) dysfunction, however there is very little understanding of the link between distinct cell populations, cell-type specific transcriptional programs and disease severity. Here, we generated a comprehensive cellular map of subcutaneous and visceral AT of individuals with metabolically healthy and unhealthy obesity.  By combining snRNA-sequencing data with bulk transcriptomics and clinical parameters, we identified that mesothelial cells, adipocytes and adipocyte-progenitor cells exhibit the strongest correlation with metabolic disease, independent of overall adiposity. Furthermore, we uncovered cell type-specific transcriptional signatures, like the transitioning of mesothelial cells from an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype, that are strongly associated with AT function and systemic health. Together, these findings provide valuable insights by revealing biological drivers of clinical endpoints.
